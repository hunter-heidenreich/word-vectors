# Word Vectors

This repo is a collection of word vector algorithms,
mostly implemented in PyTorch.

This repo is to serve, primarily, as an educational resource 
for myself (but also anyone who stumbles upon it and finds it useful).

## Algorithms
- word2vec
    - Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)
    - Skip-gram (SG)
    - CBOW with negative sampling (CBOW-NS)
    - Skip-gram with negative sampling (SG-NS)
- Global Vectors (GloVe)
